Forgiveness has been linked to improved mental health outcomes such as reduced anxiety, depression, and stress. By letting go of negative emotions and embracing empathy and compassion, individuals can achieve greater emotional regulation and resiliency. This can lead to greater overall well-being and life satisfaction.
