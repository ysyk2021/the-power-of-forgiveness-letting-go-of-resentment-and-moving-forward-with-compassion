Through therapy and support from loved ones, Sarah was able to confront her uncle and express the hurt he caused her. Although he did not apologize or acknowledge his behavior, Sarah was able to find peace within herself by letting go of the anger and resentment she held towards him.

Subchapter 2: John's Story

John's wife had an affair with his best friend, causing him immense pain and betrayal. After months of anger and bitterness, John decided to seek counseling and work on forgiving his wife and friend. Through this process, he was able to understand the flaws in his relationship and ultimately rebuild it with his wife. While he chose not to continue his friendship with his former best friend, he found peace within himself by releasing the negative emotions associated with the affair.

Subchapter 3: Maria's Story

Maria's son was killed in a tragic accident caused by a drunk driver. At first, she was consumed by anger and hatred towards the driver.
